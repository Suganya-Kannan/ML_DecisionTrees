Identifying risky bank loans using C5.0 decision trees

As the availability of credit has been limited, banks are increasingly tightening their lending systems and turning to machine learning to more accurately identify risky loans. 

Decision trees are widely used in the banking industry due to their high accuracy and ability to formulate a statistical model in plain language. It is likely that automated credit scoring models are employed for instantly approving credit applications on the telephone and the web. Here I have developed a simple credit approval model using default lists by C5.0 decision trees algorithm. The results of the model can be tuned to minimize errors that result in a financial loss for the institution.
